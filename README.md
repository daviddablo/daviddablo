### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is David Dablo and I am a second-year undergraduate student at UC San Diego pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Political Science/Data Analytics. I am interested in descriptive representation in American elections and the implications of public policy in our everyday lives. I have experience working with STATA, R, and LaTeX (three yays for social science!) as well as Java and HTML.
