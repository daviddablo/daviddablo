### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is David Dablo and I am an alumnus from the University of California, San Diego. I recieved my Bachelor of Science in Political Science/Data Analytics with a minor in Computational Social Science in June 2025. My interests span the social sciences, but my particular focus in undergrad was on electoral trust and political methodology.
